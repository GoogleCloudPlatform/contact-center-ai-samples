# Divebooker Agent - Increase intent coverage and handle errors gracefully \
  with generative response

In this codelab you'll build, deploy and configure a simple virtual agent in
Dialogflow CX to assist traveling scuba divers with group bookings and private
charters. The virtual agent will use Generative AI and Google's latest
generative large language models (LLMs) to generate virtual agent responses.

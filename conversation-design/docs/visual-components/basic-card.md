# Basic card

Use basic cards (also called entity cards) to display an image and text to
users.

## Example

Here's an example of what a basic card looks like when all required and optional
fields are completed.

    developer documentation.

## Requirements

This visual component currently supports [customization](customization.md).

If the image's aspect ratio is different than the screen, the image is centered with bars along the top or sides.</li><li>Image source is a URL.

## Guidance

Basic cards are used to describe entities (i.e. topics including people, places,
or things) â€” they're best used when a 'definition-style' response form factor is
needed. Use them to summarize information or to provide additional, relevant
information to the user.

### Summarize information for the user

<span style="color: green;">Do</span> | <span style="color: red;">Don't</span>
---|---
![Summarize do](../static/summarize-do.png){ width="300" } | ![Summarize don't](../static/summarize-dont.png){ width="300" }
Summarize things like event details using a basic card. This allows users to scan it quickly for the information they want. | It's less efficient to present information like event details in the prompts.

### Give the short answer in the prompts and the related details in the card

<span style="color: green;">Do</span> | <span style="color: red;">Don't</span>
---|---
![Put details in cards do](../static/put-deets-in-card-do.png){ width="300" } | ![Put details in cards don't](../static/put-deets-in-card-dont.png){ width="300" }
Use the spoken and display prompts to give the specific answer to the user's directed question (11:30 AM in this example). Use the visuals for related details. | Avoid redundancy between the spoken prompt, display prompt, and visuals.

### A picture is worth a thousand words

<span style="color: green;">Do</span> | <span style="color: red;">Don't</span>
---|---
![Using pictures do](../static/usingpics-do.png){ width="300" } | ![Using pictures don't](../static/usingpics-dont.png){ width="300" }
Sometimes an image is the best way to convey information to the user. | Though the description is nice, a picture would have been better.

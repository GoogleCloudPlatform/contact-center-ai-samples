# Transactions

Transactions let you build Actions that handle purchases. Building an Action
with transactions lets you create conversational ordering experiences that feel
more natural than ordering through websites and mobile apps.

## Overview

In order to build a transactional Action, you need to pick a type of
transaction. Use the guides below to determine which transaction type best suits
your needs. Then head over to our
[developer site](https://developers.google.com/assistant/transactions) to start
building.

### The 2 types of goods

All purchases fall under one of two types:

- **Physical goods**: Tangible items such as clothing, home goods, or food
- **Digital goods**: Non-tangible items such as app purchases, media (digital
  files), or software

### The 3 payment methods

There are three payment methods that can be used depending on what kind of
transaction type your Feature handles (more information below).

- **Google-managed payments**
- **Merchant-managed payments**
- **Digital transactions**

Type of goods | Payment method | How it works | How to use it
---|---|---|---
Physical | Google-managed payments | Set up your Action to let users easily pay with a payment method they've previously configured in [Google Pay](https://pay.google.com/about/). | Visit our [developer site](https://developers.google.com/assistant/transactions) for technical guidance.
Physical | Merchant-managed payments | If you have your own web or mobile store that uses OAuth 2.0 for sign-in, you can set up your Action to let users pay with a payment method they've saved on your site. | Visit our [developer site](https://developers.google.com/assistant/transactions) for technical guidance.
Digital | Digital transactions | Set up your Action to let users purchase goods you own in the Google Play store, such as digital subscriptions or other in-app purchases. | Visit our [developer site](https://developers.google.com/assistant/transactions) for technical guidance.

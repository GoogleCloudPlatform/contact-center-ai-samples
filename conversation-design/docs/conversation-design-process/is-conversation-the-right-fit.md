# Is conversation the right fit?

Conversation design is a powerful approach, but it's not right for every Action.
For example, dialog works well for the task of finding a restaurant's business
hours, but it feels clunky for browsing a dinner menu. Before you decide to use
conversation design, evaluate whether it will supercharge your Action, making it
more intuitive and efficient for users.

## Overview

Conversation can add value to your Action through its speed, simplicity, and
ubiquity.

## Take the quiz

Review the following statements to determine whether conversation design is the
right strategy for your feature. If you're checking off most of them, it's

## Case studies

Now, let’s walk through these statements for two related, but different, use
cases.

### Use case #1: "How much are flights to Zurich?"

In this use case, **conversation is better** because it is intuitive to use,
saves the user time and effort, allows the user to multitask, and is likely to
be done in an environment where the user can speak freely.

- [X] Users already have human-to-human conversations about this task or topic.
- Users already have a mental model for talking to a travel agent about flight
  costs.
- [X] The interaction is brief, with minimal back-and-forth dialog.
- Users are already familiar with the necessary information (origin,
  destination, dates, airlines, etc.) and can provide these top-of-mind in a few
  turns.
- [X] Users would have to tap multiple times to complete the task with a screen.
- Users would have to 1) unlock their phone to 2) access a search app, widget or
  browser and 3) type in all the details about origin, destination, dates, etc.,
  4) browse results.
- [ ] Users might have to navigate multiple apps or widgets to complete the task
  with a screen.
- Users could perform this task at a single flight aggregator website or app.
- [ ] The feature is difficult or cumbersome to find.
- Users could start with a simple Google search. It’s unlikely they’d need to
  work hard to find an app or website to get started.
- [X] Users can do this task while multitasking.
- The user's full attention is NOT required.
- [X] Users can do this task when their hands or eyes are busy.
- Users could complete this task eyes-free or hands-free.
- [X] Users feel comfortable talking or typing about this topic.
- Flight costs are not sensitive personal information. It’s likely that the user
is coordinating travel with family members, friends, or coworkers, so it’s
probably not an issue if someone overhears the conversation.

Use case #2: "Purchase tickets for my family to visit Zurich"

In this use case, conversation isn't better. Even though it checks some of the
boxes, conversation isn't more intuitive to use, doesn't save the user time and
effort, and doesn't allow the user to multitask.

- [ ] Users already have human-to-human conversations about this task or topic.
- Users typically write or type personal information required for purchasing a
  flight.
- [ ] The interaction is brief, with minimal back-and-forth dialog.
- The user must provide several different types of information that may not all
  be readily accessible, like passport or other identification, payment details,
  and more.
- [X] Users would have to tap multiple times to complete the task with a screen.
- Users would have to 1) unlock their phone to 2) access a search app, widget or
  browser and 3) type in all the details about origin, destination, dates, etc.,
  4) browse results, 5) choose a flight, 6) enter personal information, 7) enter
  payment information, 8) complete the transaction.
- [X] Users might have to navigate multiple apps or widgets to complete the task
  with a screen.
- Users would have to use the specific airline’s website to book, and they may
  use an aggregator to compare options.
- [ ] The feature is difficult or cumbersome to find.
- Users could start with a simple Google search or just go to the website for
  their preferred airline. It’s unlikely they’d need to work hard to find an app
  or website to get started.
- [ ] Users can do this task while multitasking.
- The user's full attention is required.
- [ ] Users can do this task when their hands or eyes are busy.
- The user will probably need to locate necessary information (e.g., passport,
  credit card) and type it in.
- [ ] Users feel comfortable talking or typing about this topic.
- The user is entering private information such as their legal name, birth date,
  passport or other identification, credit card, etc.

We are committed to making participation in this project
a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information,
such as physical or electronic

* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
By adopting this Code of Conduct,
project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently
applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project.
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct
may be permanently removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by opening an issue
or contacting one or more of the project maintainers.
